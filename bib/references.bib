  abstract = {Big data is concerned with voluminous, complex, highly unstructured data produced from numerous sources. It is expanding at immense rate these days and is a crucial issue to handle and manage the data for the analysis of required information to save both time and cost. The data extracted can be useful for the organization in various aspects. A lot of decisions have to be taken by business organizations based on this massive data. These decisions help in predicting future for various organizations such as business, social networking sites etc. In this paper, various aspects of big data along with big data analytic techniques have been discussed in detail. The various big data analytic tools and techniques have also been discussed here in this work. We also discussed various challenges that are faced during the analysis of big data along with the future research areas and directions in this particular field. It is concluded that Big Data Analytics is emerging and highly significant field of research these days. Big Data analytics can have variety of applications in different fields. The review of research carried out by various authors have also been discussed briefly. The motive of this review paper is to help the students and researchers who knew nothing about this field but want to explore this research area of Big Data Analytics. The reader of this work could solve the challenges discussed here to explore this field of Big Data Analytics and can smoothly move towards their further research.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a systematic literature review of the research field on big data analytics capabilities (BDACs). With the emergence of big data and digital transformation, a growing number of researchers have highlighted the need for organizations to develop BDACs. Despite valuable efforts to examine determinants and contributions to performance measures, the research field on BDACs remains relatively unexplored. The review reveals a patchwork of studies lacking a theoretical and conceptual foundation and questions arise regarding the reliability and validity of predominantly survey-based empirical studies. Drawing on findings from related capability concepts, this paper suggests the use of clearer definitions and items and a greater variety of methods to facilitate further exploration of BDACs. Finally, future research areas and implications are outlined.},
